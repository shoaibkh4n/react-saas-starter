# React SaaS Starter Template

This project offers an excellent foundation for developing SaaS applications with React. It incorporates a range of features essential for modern web applications, including a custom fetch wrapper for API interactions, robust authentication mechanisms, and efficient handling of public and protected routes along with a systematic approach to assets management.

## Features

- **Custom Fetch Wrapper:** Simplifies API calls with a centralized fetch mechanism, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Authentication Setup:** A complete authentication workflow, including login, logout, and session management, ensuring secure access to application resources.
- **Route Protection:** Utilizes public and protected routes to manage access to various parts of the application based on the user's authentication status.
- **Error Handling:** A catch-all route for handling 404 errors, providing a better user experience for invalid URLs.
- **Assets Management:** Organized structure for managing static assets, making it easier to reference images, styles, and other assets throughout the application.
- **TypeSafe:** Complete typesafe project. Handled everything with best practice and safety.
